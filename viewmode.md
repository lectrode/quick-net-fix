## Description ##
This setting allows the user to choose how large the command console is and how much information is displayed when the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file' title="If you don't know what this is, just think of it as a Windows program that can be edited with Notepad">batch script</a> is run. Mini mode will display the bare essentials; Normal mode will display what the script normally does by default; and Details mode will display fairly large with quite a bit of information that may or may not be comprehensible to the viewer.


**The value for this setting must be "mini" "normal" or "details" (without quotes).**

**NOTE: "details" is removed in [v5.0.355](https://code.google.com/p/quick-net-fix/source/detail?r=75be907e1999fd70ee02fc2e1b56b5fd1fcc73d7) and later**
