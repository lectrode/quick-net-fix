## Description ##
This setting was added to make the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file' title="If you don't know what this is, just think of it as a Windows program that can be edited with Notepad">batch script</a> a bit more visually descriptive. With **theme** set to "subtle", "vibrant", "fullsubtle" or "fullvibrant" the console window colors will change depending on the network status.

The value for this setting must be one of the following:

  * none   (uses default console colors)
  * subtle (uses the color of the text to display network status)
  * vibrant (uses the color of the text to display network status)
  * fullsubtle (uses the background color to display network status)
  * fullvibrant (uses the background color to display network status)
  * crazy (changes the background and text colors randomly) (**removed in [v5.0.355](https://code.google.com/p/quick-net-fix/source/detail?r=75be907e1999fd70ee02fc2e1b56b5fd1fcc73d7)**)
