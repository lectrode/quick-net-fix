# FAQ: What is qNET? #
qNET is the shortened version of the official name (Quick Net Fix) of the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file' title="If you don't know what this is, just think of it as a Windows program that can be edited with Notepad">batch script</a> and this project.

This project started out as a remake of my [Network Resetter](https://code.google.com/p/nwconnectionresetter/). I remade it with the purpose of keeping it simple, because its predecessor had gotten to the point that its complexity scared away the average user. That, and I needed a script that could detect an issue in less than a minute and could fix it in less than 10 minutes.

The latest release of qNET requires absolutely no configuration beforehand. Just run it and go. It can detect a problem in less than 10 seconds and fix it in less than 30.

Despite not needing any configuration, it still has plenty of options for advanced users. Every aspect of the script is customizable as long as you know how to open the script with notepad (or my personal favorite plain text editor: [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)). Settings can be tweaked if needed, and the most advanced users can even modify the script functionality itself.
